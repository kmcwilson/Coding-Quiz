# Challenge 4 Coding Quiz

## Description

Within this assignment I have created a responsive coding quiz. When the timer starts the user is presented with a question and when they
answer the question they are then presented with another. On the bottom of the question it will state whether the user got the question correct
or wrong. If the user answers a question incorrectly, 15 seconds is taken away from their time. When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over and the person is able to write their initials. The time they have left is their score and it is stored within local storage as well as on the page. The high scores will list how many scores are on the page.
